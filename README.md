# 🚤 Boat Racing Simulation (Java-Driven Logic)

> A fun AnyLogic simulation where 10 boats race across a track, each with unique randomly generated speeds — with race logic, movement, and timing fully coded in **Java** rather than relying on built-in AnyLogic libraries.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This simulation visualizes a race between **10 boats**, each assigned a speed using a custom formula. The model calculates:

- How long each boat takes to finish the race  
- Average speed per boat  
- Ranking and performance comparison  

The goal of the project was to **practice Java scripting inside AnyLogic**, custom movement logic, agent behavior, and KPI generation.

## 🎯 Impact Highlights
> Accomplished custom agent behavior as measured by fully Java-controlled movement logic by replacing standard AnyLogic blocks with Java-coded race physics.
> Demonstrated performance comparison visualization as measured by speed/time bar charts by computing KPIs for all 10 boats and plotting results dynamically.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Purpose | Tool |
|--------|------|
| Simulation Platform | AnyLogic (Discrete-Event & Agent-Based Simulation) |
| Core Logic | **Java Code (custom movement, speed logic, timing)** |
| Metrics / KPIs | Java + AnyLogic charts |
| Visualization | 2D animation interface |

## 🔄 How the Simulation Works
1. **10 boats are created**, each assigned a random speed.  
2. A Java formula ensures **Boat 7 always receives the highest speed**.  
3. Boats move across the track based on speed × time.  
4. The model logs:
   - Time to finish the race  
   - Ranking  
   - Speed of each boat  
5. KPI charts update automatically to show performance differences.

---

## 🖥️ How to Run
1. Open the .alp file in AnyLogic.
2. Press RUN to start the race.
3. Watch boats finish and compare KPIs.
4. Close simulation when done.

---

## 🏁 Results & Insights

- **Boat 7 consistently wins** due to the custom speed logic.  
- Other boats finish at different times due to randomized speeds.  
- Average speeds and completion times help compare performance.  

This model is simple but demonstrates **how Java can drive agent movement and behavior**, making it useful as a learning and portfolio project.
